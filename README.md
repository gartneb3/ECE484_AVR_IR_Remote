# ECE484_AVR_IR_Remote

This is for interfacing an IR remote and receiver on an Arduino Uno R3 for ECE484 using avr-gcc. Before uploading the code, be sure to have an appropriate AVR toolchain on your system. Change the path_win_avr variable in compile_script.py to reflect the path to your AVR bin folder, and then run python compile_script.py 4 com#, where # is the COM port your Arduino is connected to. Look at the compile script to see what needs to be changed based on your paths and needs (files_to_compile, directories, file_to_compile, and com_port).
