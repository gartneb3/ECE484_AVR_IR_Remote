# ECE484_AVR_IR_Remote

Interfacing of an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) on an Arduino Uno R3 for ECE484. For use, ensure an appropriate AVR toolchain is available on your system. Change the path_win_avr variable in compile_script.py to reflect the path to your AVR bin folder, and then run python compile_script.py 4 com#, where # is the COM port your Arduino is connected to.

For pin configurations, see ultrasonic.h in Ultrasoniclib. For example, to use pin 3 (PD3) as the TRIG port, lines 17 and 18 should be:

#define TRIG_PIN 3
#define TRIG_PORT D
Note that the ECHO pin may only be on pins 2 and 3 (PD2 and PD3), due to the availability of interrupts on the Arduino Uno, hence the lack of an ECHO_PORT definition.
